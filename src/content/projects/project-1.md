This tool helps you create embeddings for gene signatures using GO and ARCHS4 data.

FroGS is described in the original publication by Chen, H., King, F.J., Zhou, B. et al. Drug target prediction through deep learning functional representation of gene signatures. Nature Commun. 15, 1853 (2024). [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46089-y](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46089-y).

The app is hosted at [https://frogsembeddings.streamlit.app](https://frogsembeddings.streamlit.app).
